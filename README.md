## What is commander

Commander is a platform annotation based agnostic command framework for Minecraft server implementations.

With Commander you can write commands that have automatic permission resolving, aliasing and child command resolving!

## Why

This project was mainly written for [DynamicGui](https://github.com/ClubObsidian/DynamicGui) to simplify command registration.

## How do I use it

Commander isn't really stable enough to use yet. The API should be stabilizing when the API hits 0.1.0 and will likely have it's last breaking change when 1.0.0 is eventually released.

## Supported platforms

* Bukkit - Fully feature complete
* BungeeCord - Fully feature complete
* Sponge - To be implemented
* Velocity - To be implemented
* Nukkit - To be implemented
* Forge - Maybe some day
* Fabric - Maybe some day
